This is the folder for my Raspberry pi pico temerature monitor for my workshop. This uses the following modules.

Raspberry pi pico W = https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-w?variant=40059369619539
BME680 module = https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme680-breakout?variant=12491552129107
16x2 LCD Module = https://www.amazon.co.uk/FREENOVE-Display-Compatible-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B0B76YGDV4/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=1Q4SBN2N9MVZD&keywords=16x2+lcd&qid=1686592073&s=computers&sprefix=16x2+lcd%2Ccomputers%2C119&sr=1-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1

also a 3d printed holder was printed for this = https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1904529 (not my design)

The bme and LCd are used to display temp, humidity, air pressure and air resistivity. The Pico also logs this data in json format. 
As this data is not that important for me once the logging file reaches 90% of the available space on the pico it will delete the file and start fresh with a new one.
